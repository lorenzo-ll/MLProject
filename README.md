Fingerprint Spoofing Detection
This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at Politecnico di Torino.

üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to tackle a binary classification problem:
Fingerprint Spoofing Detection ‚Äî distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit fingerprint images.

üß† Approach
We explored and evaluated a variety of machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

In addition to standalone model evaluation, we performed model calibration and experimented with model fusion techniques to enhance overall performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers

Model calibration

Late fusion strategies for improved results
