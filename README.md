This is the project i presented for the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at Politecnico di Torino. 
The project task consists of a binary classification problem. The goal is to perform fingerprint spoofing detection, i.e. to identify genuine vs counterfeit fingerprint images.
The project consists in trying out different classifiers, ranging from Logisic Regression to Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Mixture Models.
We have also calibrated and tried out fusions of the models to obtain better results.
